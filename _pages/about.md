## About Me

I am an enthusiastic technology professional with a passion for web technologies, open source, and continuous learning. My hands-on experience with homelab projects and experimentation has enabled me to develop a strong foundation in IT and software development.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending quality time with my family and exploring the outdoors. I believe in maintaining a healthy work-life balance and am always eager to take on new challenges that foster both personal and professional growth.

This website serves as a portfolio of my projects, current work, and ideas. Built using GitHub Pages, it reflects my commitment to sharing knowledge and making my work accessible to the wider community.

Feel free to explore my projects and connect with me for collaboration or discussion.
