## About Me

I am a technology professional with a passion for web technologies, open source, and continuous learning. 
My current employment is the field of Customer support for Self service payment solutions in the Petroleum industry.

Over the years I have built a homelab with inexpensive computing (almost all second hand) which allowed me to continue learning and experimenting with tech. 

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family and exploring the outdoors. With young kids, we always look forward to camping trips in summer including visiting the beautiful beaches of Auckland.

This website serves as a portfolio of my projects, current work, and ideas. 
Built using GitHub Pages, it is free to use and is hosted by Github which means you can build and deploy the site with ease.
