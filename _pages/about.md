## About Me

I'm passionate about web technologies and open source, constantly learning and experimenting through hands-on homelab projects. Exploring new ideas and sharpening my skills is what drives me in the tech world.

When I’m not immersed in code or tech, I love spending quality time with my family and enjoying the great outdoors.

This website itself is a part of my journey—built using GitHub Pages. Initially, I considered self-hosting after purchasing a short domain, but GitHub Pages offered a simple, free solution that lets me use my own domain while keeping my projects public and accessible.

Here, I’ll be sharing my projects, current work, and creative ideas—so feel free to explore and follow along!
